# Has Target Sum Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice algorithmic problem solving
- Identify the Big O of an algorithm

## Introduction

Time for more practice! Fork and clone this lab, then **read the instructions
before running any tests**.

## Instructions

Write a function called `hasTargetSum` that receives two arguments:

- an `array` of integers
- a `target` integer

The function should return true if any pair of numbers in the array adds up to
the target number.

Here are a few examples:

```js
hasTargetSum([3, 8, 12, 4, 11, 7], 10);
// returns true, since 3 and 7 add up to 10

hasTargetSum([22, 19, 4, 6, 30], 25);
// returns true, since 19 and 6 add up to 25

hasTargetSum([1, 2, 5], 4);
// returns false, since no pair of numbers adds up to 4
```

This is a challenging problem, but you have the tools to come up with a
solution! It's ok if your initial solution isn't optimal from a runtime
perspective; it's totally fine to brute force your way to a solution and get
something working before trying to optimize.

## Problem Solving Approach

Use the
[problem solving process](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-algorithms-what-is-an-algorithm)
described in the previous lesson to come up with an approach to the problem and
write your solution:

1. Rewrite the Problem in Your Own Words
2. Write Your Own Test Cases
3. Pseudocode
4. Code
5. Make It Clean and Readable
6. Optimize

Code your solution in the `index.js` file. There's space in the `index.js` file
to write your pseudocode, but you're welcome to write pseudocode with pen and
paper if you find that more beneficial.

You should also write some additional test cases in the `index.js` file to check
your solution. After writing your test cases and coding your solution, you can
view the output of your tests by running `node index.js` in the terminal.

When you're satisfied with your code, run `npm test` to run the tests and
submit the lab in CodeGrade.

Once you've completed your implementation, determine what the time and space
complexity of your algorithm is using Big O notation. If you came up with more
than one approach, what are the tradeoffs? Which is more efficient?

## Conclusion

In the next lesson, we'll review some solutions to this problem and talk through
how to apply the problem solving process to this exercise. Take your time with
this, and give it your best effort before reviewing the solution â€” it's ok if
you don't end up with a working solution on the first try, so long as you make a
deliberate effort at developing your problem solving process!
